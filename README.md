V1.0 - Date: 2023.02.01.

Here are some recommendations for using the dashboard:

+ Start with the Overall Revenue Performance section to get an understanding of revenue flow, with YTD/MTD measures, monthly and daily trends, and by dimensions such as channel and country. You can switch between different date types and the whole dashboard will adjust automatically.

+ To analyze revenue variances, switch to the Revenue Variance Analysis section which provides trends of revenue, orders, daily revenue, or daily orders by important dimensions like channel, country, group, subcategory, and weekend. Additionally, viewers can drill through to the Revenue Detail Page for further insights by right-clicking on a specific month.

+ Utilize the Revenue Detail section to delve into specific details of a particular month, such as revenue breakdown by day of the week or reseller. Additionally, the decision tree feature allows you to view revenue at different dimension combination levels.

+ The Report View section is for reporting purposes, where you can choose to report by channel or reseller. Note that if you filter by Top N Resellers, the revenue total will be different from the Revenue Report by Top Resellers + Others due to the "Others" category.
